After working out some scheduling issues, Craftagious members were back at their fibrous arts on Monday. You may have seen Amber's picture on HeatSync's front page showing off the hat she was working on for her Lumpy Space Princess costume.

Amber said she is currently one of two people who is helping to organize Craftagious meetups at HeatSync. While the group used to be at the lab every Monday at 6pm, they will now be around every other Monday at 6pm, the next being Nov. 4.

<b>Speaking of costumes</b>, several people have been spotted in the lab working on projects for Halloween. This is Ray C. with his brand new Wolverine claws made with assisted from Erik W. on the laser. This file for the claws was actually a fortuitous find in the laser projects archive. Ray said his wife is going as Jean Grey and his daughter is going as Rogue.

And Oliver F., our 3D printer Champion, printed a replica of Tony Stark's arc reactor.

He said it took him about a month to make, though without trial and error, it was five to seven hours of printing time, two hours build time and about 30 minutes of wiring time for the LEDs and the Arduino. He made the files with 123d design, basing it off of version he found on Thingiverse. He said that he is now working on a design for a smaller, brighter version.
